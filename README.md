![virtual_group](https://github.com/msamylea/autogen_focus_group/assets/44280406/e44684e1-96a4-475d-a432-4e4aaae24c7a)


Virtual focus group with multiple custom personas, product details, and final analysis created with AutoGen, Ollama/Llama3, and Streamlit. 

Uses custom GroupChat and custom GroupChatManager to output the content to Streamlit in an organized, clean chat by removing blank messages and formatting content to use sender name.

Create up to 5 Personas (you can change the data used in `demographics_dict.py`).  They are saved to `docs/personas.json`.

To analyze the discussion, run analysis from Analyze Final Results. 

The TERMINATE function does not trigger well with this code and Llama3, so if you're able to fix that part, let me know how you did it.

## Operational Customization
Run a virtual focus group with the personas by entering a topic of discussion and kicking it off.  
* Create your own persona meta datas in `demographics_dict.py` or reuse the default.
* Create your own pre-loaded populations in docs/personas.json
* To change the discussion length, edit max_round in `./pages/1 Run Virtual Focus Group.py` groupchat entry.  
* The final chat will be saved to `./docs/chat_summary.txt`.
* The final summary wil lbe saved to `docs/final_analysis.md`.


## Model Selection

By default, the model will use ``llama3:latest`` (see `config.py` for a one-location update for the entire project), but you can customize it with the following steps.

* The 'l3custom' model mentioned is just the standard Ollama llama3:latest rebuilt with this Modelfile:

```dockerfile 
  FROM llama3:latest
  TEMPLATE """{{ if .System }}<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
  
  {{ .System }}<|eot_id|>{{ end }}{{ if .Prompt }}<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
  
  {{ .Prompt }}<|eot_id|>{{ end }}<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
  
  {{ .Response }}<|eot_id|>"""
  PARAMETER num_keep 24
  PARAMETER stop "<|start_header_id|>"
  PARAMETER stop "<|end_header_id|>"
  PARAMETER stop "<|eot_id|>"
  PARAMETER stop Human:
  PARAMETER stop Assistant:
```

## Dependencies

In a clean environment run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.

## Logging and Debugging
logging turned on in Home.py, writing into logs.db. sql commands of use:
* sqlite3 logs.db
* .tables
* SELECT * FROM events ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;
* SELECT * FROM chat_completions ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5;
* SELECT * FROM oai_clients;
* SELECT * FROM function_calls ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5;
